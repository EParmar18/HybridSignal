This repo is the CSC Hacks team project repository that meets all of [the repository requirements](https://www.notion.so/CSC-Hacks-901a62e005c8494fa342e0cc738101ad#da206965e3ed497f9bd6c1ceebd4fac9).

## Project Description
* We want to use market data along with certain indicators (Ex. EMA's, MACD, RSI, VOLUME, etc) to find buy/sell opportunites for a stock using Python, Yahoo Finance API, TD Ameritrade API, NumPy, Pandas.
* We want to do this because we want to explore working with financial data and trying to implement optimal strategies. Also we both like finanance/stock stuff
* Doing this will require learning the TD Ameritrade API, how to compute the algorithms required for indicators, understand the metrics used to judge a financial strategy.
* We anticipate the following challenges: Getting a full understanding of the algorithms for indicators with require a good amount of research, the actual implementation of indicators and choosing the optimal strategy, understanding metrics.
